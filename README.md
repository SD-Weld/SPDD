Title: SPDD: A Synergistic Perception Defect Detector for Complex Spiral Weld Images

To provide a clearer understanding of the spiral steel pipe production and defect detection process, we have included a supplementary material in our paper.


This is the open source URL for the paper "SPDD: A Synergistic Perception Defect Detector for Complex Spiral Weld Images" submitted to IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics. 
We will publish our code and datasets soon.
